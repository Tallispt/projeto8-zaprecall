# ZapRecall

[**ZapRecall**](http://tallispt-zaprecall.vercel.app) is a React based website that simulates a training method using flashcards.

- Flashcards are cards that contain a question/statement on the front and an answer on the back. 
- They can be used to train your memory using the Active Recall and Spaced Repetition methodologies. 
- The idea is to read the question or statement and try to remember the answer. 
- When you come across it again, depending on how much effort you need to answer the flashcard, you become aware of which contents are fresh in your memory and which ones are not. 
- Then, you can practice the contents that are not fresh frequently.
- When you recall a flashcard instantly, you've had a "Zap!". Sets of flashcards are called decks.
